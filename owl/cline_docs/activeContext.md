# Active Context

**Project:** Owl - Personal AI Assistant

**Current Focus:** Software Upgrade from GitHub

**Recent Changes:**

- Upgraded Owl to the latest version from the GitHub repository.
- Fetched latest changes from remote repository 'origin'.
- Merged changes from 'origin/main' branch into local 'master' branch, allowing unrelated histories and resolving initial merge conflicts by stashing local changes.
- Local changes stashed before merge were successfully merged without conflicts.

**Next Steps:**

- Review the changelog or release notes for the updated version to understand new features and changes.
- Test the upgraded software to ensure it's working as expected.
- Consider unstashing and reapplying any previously stashed local changes if needed and if they are still compatible with the new version.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

- Successfully upgraded Owl software using Git commands: `fetch origin` and `merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories`.
- Stashed local changes before merge to avoid conflicts and ensure a clean upgrade process.

**Pending Issues:**

- No known issues at this time. Upgrade appears to be successful.
